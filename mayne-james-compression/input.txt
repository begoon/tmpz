/* ~$F  LARGE FREE STRING SPACE
   A TEXT COMPRESSION PROGRAM.

   AUTHOR -- CHARLES WETHERELL  18 AUGUST 1976.
   LAST DATE MODIFIED -- 25 AUGUST 1976.

   THIS PROGRAM COMPRESSES TEXT FILES USING THE MAYNE-JAMES DICTIONARY
   CONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM.  INPUT IS AN ARBITRARY TEXT FILE AND OUTPUT
   IS THE COMPRESSED FILE ALONG WITH AN ENCODING DICTIONARY.  SOME
   STATISTICS ON PROGRAM EFFICIENCY AND COMPRESSION RATE ARE KEPT.
   TWO PASSES BY THE SOURCE FILE ARE NECESSARY.  ON THE FIRST PASS THE
   DICTIONARY IS BUILT AND A RECORD OF ALL CHARACTERS SEEN IS KEPT.
   BETWEEN PASSES THE CHARACTER RECORD IS USED TO ADD ENCODINGS TO THE
   DICTIONARY ENTRIES.  DURING THE SECOND PASS, LONG HIGH FREQUENCY
   STRINGS ARE REPLACED BY SHORTER ENCODING STRINGS AS THE COMPRESSED
   FILE IS WRITTEN.  FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE TECHNIQUE CAN BE
   FOUND IN CHAPTER 11 OF

     WETHERELL, C.S.  ETUDES FOR PROGRAMMERS.  PRENTICE-HALL,
        ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, NJ.  1978.

   IN THIS VERSION OF THE ALGORITHM, ENDS OF INPUT LINES STOP STRING
   MATCHES DURING DICTIONARY CONSTRUCTION AND TEXT ENCODING; THE
   CARRIAGE RETURN IS NOT TREATED LIKE A CHARACTER.  ONLY CHARACTERS
   WHOSE INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS LIE IN THE RANGE 1 TO 127 WILL BE
   CONSIDERED FOR ENCODING PAIRS SO THAT THE PAIRS WILL HAVE
   REASONABLE PRINT REPRESENTATIONS.  IN A FULL WORKING IMPLEMENTATION
   ALL 256 AVAILABLE CHARACTERS WOULD BE USED FOR ENCODING.
